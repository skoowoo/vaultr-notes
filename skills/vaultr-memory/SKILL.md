# Vaultr Memory Extract

Extracts personal memories from short notes (`/_shorts`) and the knowledge base (`/_knowledge`) into six structured memory files under `/_memory/`. On first run (no memory files exist yet), scans the last 90 days for a rich initial snapshot. On subsequent runs, scans only the last 2 days. Memories not reinforced over time gradually fade and are eventually removed.

**Run all steps to completion without stopping or asking for confirmation.** Only speak at the final summary step.

---

## Inputs

1. **Self-introduction** — a brief description the user provides about themselves (name, role, projects, relationships, etc.). Used throughout extraction to identify personal content and disambiguate knowledge units. Ask for this if not provided.
2. **Extra scan paths** — additional vault path prefixes to scan beyond the two defaults (optional).
3. **Memory directory** — where memory files live (default: `/_memory/`).

---

## Step 1 — Determine run mode

Check whether any memory file already exists:

```bash
vaultr read /_memory/_identity.md
```

- **First run** (file not found): set `scan_window = 90` days.
- **Incremental run** (file exists): set `scan_window = 2` days.

Record today's date as `today`.

Parse the self-introduction into an **author profile** to use as a lens throughout extraction:
- Name and known aliases/IDs
- Projects or products the author owns or runs (these may appear as vault directories or knowledge unit titles)
- Roles (creator, host, founder, etc.)
- People the author mentions as part of their personal life

This profile is critical for the knowledge base step: if a `source_notes` path falls under a directory that belongs to the author's own project (e.g. their own podcast, their own product), treat it as a **personal source**, not an external one.

---

## Step 2 — Collect content to process

Run both queries in parallel:

```bash
vaultr short list --latest <scan_window> --limit 100
vaultr knowledge list --kind knowledge --latest <scan_window> --limit 50
```

Also run `vaultr list <path> --latest <scan_window>` for each extra scan path provided.

If all queries return zero results, skip to Step 4.

---

## Step 3 — Extract evidence

Apply different extraction rules depending on the source.

### Source A: Short notes (`/_shorts`)

`vaultr short list` returns each entry's `content` inline — process directly, no file reads needed.

Short notes are the author's own unfiltered voice. Extract from **all six dimensions**:

| Dimension       | File              | What qualifies                                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **identity**    | `_identity.md`    | Stable facts: name, job title, location, family, languages                      |
| **preferences** | `_preferences.md` | Likes/dislikes, tools of choice, aesthetic tastes expressed as the author's own |
| **goals**       | `_goals.md`       | Active projects, ambitions, things the author is working toward                 |
| **beliefs**     | `_beliefs.md`     | Worldview, recurring opinions, values the author endorses                       |
| **people**      | `_people.md`      | Named individuals and their relationship to the author                          |
| **state**       | `_state.md`       | Near-term mood, current struggles, what is top of mind                          |

### Source B: Knowledge base (`/_knowledge`)

`vaultr knowledge list` returns file paths. Read each unit:

```bash
vaultr knowledge read <path>
```

**Classify each unit by its `source_notes` paths, using the author profile from Step 1:**

**Class 1 — Author's own content** (source_notes point to the author's own projects — e.g. their own podcast directory, their own product notes — or to personal paths like `/_shorts/`, `/journal/`)

The unit captures the author's own words or experience. Extract from **all six dimensions**, same as Source A.

**Class 2 — External source** (source_notes point to content produced by others — podcasts the author listened to, articles, clips)

Body content synthesises what the author heard or read, not their own views. Extract only:
- `## 立场` section → `beliefs` (the author's own dated opinion; skip if section absent)
- Unit title + tags → `preferences` as `关注 <title>（<tags>）` (compiling a topic signals genuine interest)
- **Do not** extract people (third-party guests and case-study figures are not personal relationships)
- **Do not** extract from body sections like `## 核心启示`, `## 关键认知`, `## 核心定义` — these synthesise others' views

**Class 3 — No source_notes**

Treat as personal. Extract from all six dimensions.

**When classification is ambiguous**, use the author profile: if the directory or context matches something the author owns or created, prefer Class 1.

### Source C: Extra scan paths

Treat as personal notes. Extract from all six dimensions.

---

## Step 4 — Update memory files

For each dimension with new evidence, read the current file (if it exists), apply the update rules, then write the result.

### File format

```markdown
---
decay_window: <Xd>
last_updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

## Active
- <item text> `last:<YYYY-MM-DD> seen:<N>`

## Fading
- <item text> `last:<YYYY-MM-DD> seen:<N>`
```

### Decay windows

| File              | decay_window |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `_identity.md`    | 365d         |
| `_beliefs.md`     | 90d          |
| `_preferences.md` | 90d          |
| `_people.md`      | 90d          |
| `_goals.md`       | 30d          |
| `_state.md`       | 7d           |

### Update rules (apply in this order)

**A — New evidence matches an existing Active item:** Update `last` to today, increment `seen`.

**B — New evidence matches a Fading item:** Promote to Active, update `last` to today, increment `seen`.

**C — New item not yet in the file:** Add to `## Active` with `last:<today> seen:1`.

**D — Active item with no new evidence:** If `(today − last) > decay_window`, move to `## Fading`. Do not change `last` or `seen`.

**E — Fading item with no new evidence:** If `(today − last) > 2 × decay_window`, delete entirely.

**F — Same fact, different wording:** Merge into one item — keep the clearer wording, sum `seen`, use the more recent `last`.

### Writing the file

```bash
vaultr create /_memory/_<dimension>.md --content "<content>"           # new
vaultr create /_memory/_<dimension>.md --content "<content>" --force   # overwrite
```

Only write files that actually changed.

## Step 5 — Summary

Report:
- Run mode (first run / incremental) and scan window used
- Items processed per source (shorts / knowledge / extra)
- Which memory files were updated
- Counts: added / refreshed / faded / deleted
- Deleted items by name (for user verification)
